# Marinovich Sprint Timer


## 🎯 Philosophy & Purpose

The Marinovich Sprint Timer is built on the training principles of renowned athletic trainer Marv Marinovich. This tool digitizes his proven sprint test protocol, which is designed to:

- **Measure Anaerobic Capacity**: Track an athlete's ability to maintain maximum power output
- **Assess Recovery Efficiency**: Monitor how well athletes recover between high-intensity efforts
- **Track Performance Degradation**: Observe the decline in sprint performance over multiple efforts
- **Build Mental Toughness**: Push athletes to their limits in a structured environment

The test protocol is simple yet demanding:
1. Perform a 100m sprint at maximum effort
2. Rest for exactly 60 seconds
3. Repeat until performance significantly degrades
4. Analyze the results to assess fitness level

## 🚀 Features

- **Precision Sprint Timer**: Millisecond-accurate timing for performance tracking
- **Automated Recovery**: 60-second countdown timer between sprints
- **Voice Control**: Hands-free operation with voice commands
- **Sprint History**: Session-based performance tracking
- **Progressive Web App**: Works offline and can be installed on mobile devices
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for field use on any device

### Key Features Implementation

#### Voice Recognition
```typescript
// Uses Web Speech API for hands-free control
const recognition = new window.webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.continuous = true;
recognition.interimResults = true;
```

#### Timer Precision
```typescript
// High-precision timing using performance.now()
const startTime = performance.now();
const interval = setInterval(() => {
  const elapsed = performance.now() - startTime;
}, 10); // Updates every 10ms
```

## 🚦 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/marinovich-sprint.git

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

## 📱 Usage

1. **Starting a Sprint**
   - Click START button or say "start"
   - Timer begins with millisecond precision
   - Visual feedback indicates sprint is active

2. **Ending a Sprint**
   - Click STOP button or say "stop"
   - Sprint time is recorded
   - Recovery period begins automatically

3. **Recovery Period**
   - 60-second countdown displays
   - Progress bar shows time remaining
   - Next sprint is blocked until recovery completes

4. **Viewing Results**
   - Expand Sprint History panel
   - Review all sprint times
   - Analyze performance degradation
